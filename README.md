## GANs Project: Face Generation

The project files are located in the Project Workspace and include the following files:

* **`dlnd_face_generation_starter.ipynb`**
* **`README.md`**
* **`requirements.txt`**
* **`tests.py`**
* **`processed-celeba-small.zip`**

### Instructions

Open the notebook file, `dlnd_face_generation_starter.ipynb` and run each section. This project is organized as follows:

* **Data Pipeline**: implemented a data augmentation function and a custom dataset class to load the images and transform them
* **Model Implementation**: built a custom generator and a custom discriminator to make a GAN
* **Loss Functions and Gradient Penalty**: use the Wasserstein loss function and gradient penalty
* **Training Loop**: implemented the training loop.

Building a deep learning model is an iterative process, and it's especially true for GANs! Good luck!
